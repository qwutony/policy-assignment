# Review and Prepare Documents Relating to Privacy, Confidentiality and Ethics

## T2-2A1

**Scenario: A Start-Up in Need of Documents**

You are working for a new business that does not have adequate protections in place for its intellectual property, or the confidentiality and privacy of its own, and its clients' information.

You have been asked to investigate other businesses and government guidelines so you can contribute to the implementation of the following policies and documents:

a privacy policy regarding personal information and determine its requirements with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information
a copyright policy relating to procedures and requirements for minimising the risk of copyright infringement
a code of ethics relating to the behaviour of staff
the protection of confidential information through the use of a non-disclosure agreement for contractors that work on-site at the business, who will overhear confidential information, and have access to organisational data and client information
create a draft grievance procedure for handling and review of alleged breaches of ethics confidentially

## T2-2A2

**Determine how the policy deals with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information in the space provided in the checklist.**

*Confidentiality*: The CBA privacy policy states how they handle personal information by aiming to be clear and open about what the information will be used for. This includes what information is collected from customers, as well as how they use the information, and who they share the information with.

*Integrity*: The CBA privacy policy states that they share information with other parties, but that it shouldn't be editable or changeable by other parties. It is possible to access and update/correct the information by visiting the branch or calling the organisation.

*Availability*: Information is kept safe through adequate staff training, secure handling and storage, system security, building security and destroying information when it is no longer needed.

## T2-2A3

**Draft a list of steps that an employee could undertake to follow that policy, and provide an example of how you would use the policy in relation to a specific copyrighted material such as an image, piece of software.**

1. Understand the purpose and scope of the copyright policy, and who it is intended for.
2. Understand the individual responsibilities, which are listed in a checklist. 
3. Understand the various uses that do not need a copyright clearance, such as educational purposes.
4. Understand how much is considered a 'reasonable portion' for copyright to be enforced.
5. Understand the non-compliance and disciplinary actions as a result of breach.

If a person was to use a copyrighted picture that they found from google or another search engine / website, it is their duty to cite and give appropriate credit to the owner of the image, unless it falls under a specific exception that does not require copyright clearance. If this image is not cited, the organisation or individual may be liable to a non-compliance and disciplinary offence.

## T2-2A4

**The review should state whether the code of ethics will be appropriate for the business described in the scenario. Your review should include:**

**Highlight points that you would include in your business' code of ethics, and provide a short comment why they are important (you must highlight at least three parts)**
 - 'We conduct outselves professionally': Is important to add in my code of ethics since each indvidual should the root of all ethical issues is derived from professional misconduct. This can prevent employees and employers alike from acting out of line.
 - 'We act with honesty, integrity and fariness': Is important to ensure that individuals act not just ethically, but to be honest, with integrity and fair, thus creating a more coherent and comfortable community.
 - 'We manage conflicts of interest': Is important to ensure that personal and business interests should never be a reason to cause individuals to be unable to objectively make sound decisions.

**A general comment in no less than 3 sentences which addresses the suitability of this code of ethics as a model for your organisation's code of ethics**

The Code of Ethics from NAB is a suitable model for the proposed code of ethics for my organisation. The Code is clear and concise, easy to read and explains everything in detail to provide individuals with an accurate path to becoming an ethical employee/employer in the workforce. The Code is subdivided into sections that tailor to specific circumstances, so it can be easily referred to during times of need.

## T2-2A6

**Create an outline for a grievance policy to handle alleged ethical breaches of the code of ethics.**

```
The outline must:
- provide at least three steps which detail what will occur starting from a person raising a breach up to it being resolved
- explain how the confidentiality of the person raising the breach will be maintained
- provide one example of an ethical breach and how the policy would handle it
```

Grievance Policy (Prototype)

1. Where an issue arises, an affected individual(s) of the organisation has the right and/or responsibility to make sure the issue is addressed. The organisation should provide a safe and secure channel of communication to the human resource team, and they are allowed to remain anonymous when bringing up a grievance.
2. The team handling grievances must address the issue to the criteria so as to protect the interests of the affect parties. The person who committed the grievance should be contacted by the team, and relevant procedures should be maintained to ensure a fair and just conclusion is reached.
3. This should adhere to the Code of Conduct and the various sections outlined in the document.
4. Afterwards, if the issue has been resolved, the incident should be reported with anonymity considered, but the interest of the parties should remain priority.

In this case, say for example an employee was allegedly harassed by the direct manager. The affected employee can contact a team through an anonymous hotline, and then the team would respond by questioning the direct manager. If conclusive, the manager will be punished as per the Code of Conduct. The incident should be reported with anonymity, and the incident will conclude after that.
