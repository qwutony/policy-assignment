a privacy policy regarding personal information and determine its requirements with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information
a copyright policy relating to procedures and requirements for minimising the risk of copyright infringement
a code of ethics relating to the behaviour of staff
the protection of confidential information through the use of a non-disclosure agreement for contractors that work on-site at the business, who will overhear confidential information, and have access to organisational data and client information
create a draft grievance procedure for handling and review of alleged breaches of ethics confidentially
