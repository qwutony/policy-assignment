# Developer Workbook (Term 4)

## Q1: Research TWO codes of ethics used by computing or IT industry bodies and discuss how they are relevant to the work of an IT professional. 

The first Code of Ethics that has been looked at is th ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. ACM stands for the Association for Computing Machinery, and is a society that intends to deliver educational resources to help advance and improve science and computing and related profession. Therefore, their work is strongly related to act as a tool to inspire and guide the work of computing professionals, whether they are instructors and educators of the profession, students who are learning to enter the workforce and practitioners who utilise computing technology in a regular and impactful way.

The Code of Conduct and standards that are outlined in by ACM (link: https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) is multifaceted. The intention of a Code of Conduct that is especially dedicated to computing professionals is to allow individuals to be about to reflect on the impacts of their work, and ultimately help maintain the public good. Within the general ethical principles section, the standards believe that people are all stakeholders in computing, and rely on computing professionals to use their abilities to promote the benefits of computing, and minimise the threats and negative consequences that can stem from computing. The work of an IT professional often comes with risks, but implementing these ethical codes of conduct can ensure that when interests are conflicted that the professional will be able to choose the correct path, such as respecting diversity, paying attention to the less advantaged, and contribute their work to community and society as a whole. These are just some examples as to why the ACM code of conduct serves signficant relevance to IT professionals if they are expected to become role models of the computing industry.

Another Code of Ethics that is set out for IT Professionals from ACS, which stands for the Australian Computer Society. This society is governed by the national Management Committee. The Code of Conduct for the ACS is built into the ACS constitution, and strongly emphasises to be 'an honour(able), digni(fied) and effective' professional. The Code of Conduct wishes the members and IT professionals to not only be good citizens by abiding the law, but also to societal values, which include public interest, enhancement of the quality of life, honesty, competence, professional development and professionalism.

This code directly addresses IT professionals and relates to how they should act to ensure they are responsible citizens. Promoting public interest and placing it with precedence over personal and business interests is intuitive because it facilitates the overall stability of society in general, as does striving to enhance the quality of life of those who are affected by the work of the professionals.


## Q2: Identify Federal or State laws, and policies which relate to an ICT environment in terms of the following areas:

**Access and equity**
Federal Law: Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth) and Work Place Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) and Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)

Policies: The Australian Human Rights Commission has default policies that are recommended for organisations to incorporate into their own. Link: https://www.humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/12076.


**Copyright and intellectual property**
Federal Law: Copyright Act 1968

Policies: Various policies enforced by the Australian Copyright Council. These can be found here: https://www.copyright.org.au/ACC_Prod/ACC/Public_Content/Information_Sheets_A-Z.aspx?WebsiteKey=8a471e74-3f78-4994-9023-316f0ecef4ef. Examples include 3D Printing, Competitions, Creative licensing and design.

**Workplace health and safety**

Federal Law: Work Health and Safety Act 2011

Policies: The main policy for Victoria is the Occupational Health and Safety policy, which falls under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004. These policies are managed by WorkSafe, on this website: https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/occupational-health-and-safety-your-legal-duties.

**Privacy**

Federal Law: Privacy Act 1988

Policies: Each individual company will have their own privacy policies, that are all in compliance to the Australian Privacy Principles (APP). This can be found in the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner website: https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles.


## Q3: Analyse and discuss how laws or government policy relate to an ICT environment relating to access and equity. You must illustrate the relationship between law and the ICT environment using an example or case study.

There are a variety of government policies that attempt to promote fair and equal access, regardless of a persons gender, sexuality, race, nationality etc. These policies are universal within the context of Australia, and therefore can be used in an field of employment and not just ICT. There are many broad areas of access and equity, however these are generally confined to three categories: Discrimination, Harassment and Affirmative Action. An example of a piece of Federal Legislation that can be used in an ICT environment is the Fair Work Act 2009. 

The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) is a piece of Commonwealth Legislation that intends to regulate employment and workplace relations. It allows the designation of employment, and sets out the rights and responsibilities between employer and employee regarding the terms of that employment. In this example, whenever an employer or employee has an issue regarding the employment negotiations, s/he or the organisation is allowed to use the Fair Work Act as a means to discuss and negotiate the terms of a contract that can be fair and equitable. If a prospective employee in the ICT field, say for example Penetration Testing, is offered a below standard renumeration for his level of work, he is allowed to use the Fair Work Act, which covers all employment in Victoria, ACT and the Northern Territory.

## Q4: Analyse and discuss how laws or government policy relate to an ICT environment relating to copyright and intellectual property. You must illustrate the relationship between law and a positive outcome in an ICT environment using an example or case study.

The Copyright Law of Australia mainly defines the enforceable rights of creators and artistic works that are protected under Australian Law. It covers the entirely of Australia, as serves to allow for fair dealing and fair use of artisitic creations.  The copyright law is especially important in the ICT environment because there are a lot of different creations that should be protected. An example would be to protect the infringment of a computer program.

Say for example a party has created a computer program that serves to allow users to lint their own programs more efficiently. In the ICT environment, someone can take the program and use it for their own purposes, and if the program is not open source, then it will be a violation of copyright. Normally, it would be unfortunate and the programmer cannot exercise any rights, however, the copyright act will allow them to have grounds to sue and act for remediation. Thus, this will result in a positive outcome for the victim party.

## Q5: Analyse and discuss how laws or government policy relate to an ICT environment relating to workplace health and safety. You must illustrate the relationship between law and a positive outcome in an ICT environment using an example or case study.

In an ICT environment, there are many computers and servers and other gadgets that are commonly seen in the these environments. In any workplace, there are always problematic and dangerous objects that can cause physical and bodily harm to people who work there. Implementing a policy or abiding the Work Health and Safety Act within an organisation can serve to protect the interests of individuals who are a participant in the organisation. 

An example will be that in the event of cleaning in the kitchen/rest area of an IT firm, an employee slips due to the cleaners negligence, and this causes a significant injury because he hit the sharp side of a commercial printer. Normally, even though there is negligence on behalf of the employer, the employee is not protected by any act that will allow them to be compensated. The Work Health and Safety Act ensures that those who are injured in place of work can have grounds to pursue compensation as a result of others negligence.

## Q6: Analyse and discuss how laws or government policy relate to an ICT environment relating to privacy. You must illustrate the relationship between law and a positive outcome in an ICT environment using an example or case study.

The Privacy Act 1988 handles the main privacy policies for various organisations around Australia. An ICT environment adopts these policies that are from the APP, which they can use to transform into their own unique privacy policies. An ICT environment could have clauses that are specifically tailored to them, such as the privacy of handling personal information, as in the case of a major banking corporation. 

In the circumstance where information is publically disclosed where it shouldn't be, such as in a case where a spiteful ex-employee reveals the private information of his former colleagues and bosses, the parties are bound by a privacy agreement, and the violation of this is punishable by law, which will compensate the damages associated with the revealing of private and personal information. 

## Q7: Outline FOUR techniques for gathering information regarding new information and communication technologies.

 - Use passive information gathering strategies such as online research and compilation of data regarding information and communication technologies. This can be through search engine discovery.

 - Using established channels for information gathering. These include secondary sources of parties that have already done their own research, and can include various online articles and websites, educational videos etc.

 - Active gathering of information through direct involvement. This includes the act of creating or being part of the development cycle of the technology, and thus gaining access to information about the technology.
 
 - Through contacting of those who are knowledgeable. Contacting the creator, spokesperson, or other knowledgeable personel can allow for gathering information at a fast rate.

## Q8: Describe two ways in which risk is analysed in relation to the security of computer systems.

Risk can be analysed in two ways - business risk and potential financial consequences, and the security risk and actual realistic consequences.

Risk is normally a business concept, because it represents the likelihood of financial consequences that stem from a particular action, or in the case of security of computer systems, the negligence or omission of certain actions. These can be either high, medium, low or negligable. However, to determine the level of risk to a business, it is possible to use the business risk matrix, which is a 5x5 table with severity ratings that measure the consequences and potential damage of a vulnerability on one axis, and the likelihood of that action happening on another axis. The multiple of these numbers results in the risk.

Another measurement of risk in relation to the security of computer systems is the actual risk or security risk. Several websites dedicate themselves to measuring the severity of particular vulnerabilities in systems from 0 to 10. This is the CVSS, or the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, and allows an ethical hacker to determine the problem of the vulnerability based off actual implications, such as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of particular systems.

## Q9: Describe TWO security procedures and how they address risk, provide an example relating to:

The purpose of a security procedure is to ensure there is a consistent security control, which is followed and implemented to allow for protection, whether it is physical or information security.

**Physical security**
A security procedure will be to always lock all the doors, and shut down certain facilities when there are no employees on site. This addresses risk because it means that certain unauthorised personel will not be able to infiltrate the building without going to unnecessary lengths, which may deter malicious orchestrators of crime.

**Information security**
Implement an authentication and authorisation system that only allows employees and relevant personel to access systems and infrastructure within the organisation. Having a login system for each employee can ensure that those who are unauthorised to be quickly investigated and prevented from causing any damage to internal systems, which may have valuable information stored on it.

## Q10: Outline systems management and process control in relation to security in terms the following aspect of a system:

**Allocation of user roles and privileges**

User roles and privileges within an organisational internal infrastructure is generally allocated through a domain system management. In this case, an administrator or domain controller would give a user privileges based on their actual position within the organisation, and those who are visiting will receive a guest account.

In circumstances where the user roles and privileges are violated, the administrators duty is to prevent further escalation by locking out accounts that have been breached.

**On boarding procedures for new users and/or procedures for add/removing user roles and privileges**

New users are instructed to login with default credentials in the beginning, before being prompted to change their password. A password strength checker can be imposed so that the password is sophisticated and difficult to guess. Various user roles and privileges can be added and subtracted depending on whether it is necessary to do so.

## Q11: Explain the following systems technologies and write a broad summary of their general features and capabilities:

**Containerisation**
Containerisation is the virtualisation on the Operating System level, which allows for any application to be stored, transported and run. An application like Docker which focuses on creating and managing containers can be used to create an image of a particular application, so that it can be easily deployed in a separate environment. Each container encapsulate an application, and it will contain their own operating environment.

**Orchestration**
Orchestration is a information technology term that refers to when there is a lot of automation of certain processes. Automating an entire process takes many different steps, and thus orchestration is a better encapsulating term for automatic on a higher level.

Orchestration is the automation of arrangements, coordination and management of various computer systems, and often uses many tasks that are already automated to achieve greater automation of a larger scale. The aim of orchestration is to make processes streamlined and optimal, whilst ensuring that there is accurate and speedy deployment of the orchestrated process/software/application.

**Identity and access management**
Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of processes, policies and integration fo technologies that allows for the management of electronic and digital identities. This allows IT administrators to control user access by only allow certain people to have credentials to enter the system, and users are limited by their privileges.

**Storage systems (databases + storage buckets)**
Storage systems are dedicated memory that is used to store information. These include database systems. Database systems are physical servers that store databases, which in turn are applications that are used to store information in various formats.
