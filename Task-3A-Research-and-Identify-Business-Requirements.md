# Task 3A - Research and Identify Business Requirements

Conduct research on a chosen business to identify whether its business priorities align with the implementation and benefits of a technology. You must:

-----------------------------------------------

**T3A1** Identify, collect and reference THREE pieces of information from different sources generated by the business, such as: annual reports, financial statements, strategic plans, policy statements, media releases, or any content on their website that relates to their business priorities or suitability for the implementation of an industry specific technology. Provide full references for the source of information.

The industry specific technology is **Docker**. The sources are listed in the bibliography below.

 - From Facebook-Annual-Report.pdf: 

The intention of Facebook and it's various subsidiaries is to create new and useful, engaging products that serve to allow interconnectivity between family and friends through the use of hardware technology such as mobile phones, personal computers and other mediums. This means that they prioritise using new and unique technologies and continue to serve at the frontier of social connectivity. The Facebook business model emphasises on continuous innovation and improving products experience. This also raises the issue of scalability, as there are more and more users that regularly interact with Facebook each day.

The business and community continue to grow, with a privacy focused vision for the future of social networking. The increase in daily and month average users represent the need for additional opportunities to scale and be more efficient with the use of services. Docker allows the easy creation and deployment of applications using containers, which not only free up space in servers, but allows for rapid deployment of necessary systems.

The first quarter 2019 results conference call for Facebook talks about the increasing interest in privacy for social media and digital connections. And thus, Facebook will have an interest in building a privacy focused platform. For the future of social media networking, Mark Zuckerberg stated that they will follow several principles, including interoperability and secure data storage. The notion of a secure data storage means that data will not be improperly accessed because of weak rules or laws that governments can undertake, which can forcibly access your data from the perspective of Docker. It is important for Facebook to continue to adopt this technology and continue innovating and improving on creating Docker servers, not only to improve storage capabilities, but also to be able to improve the privacy of the servers and systems, and allow the platform to have a greater opportunity to be at risk.

**T3A2** Identify, collect and reference THREE pieces of information about the business from external sources which may include media sources (online news, newspaper articles, reviews, blogs), publications (professional or industry journals, government reports). Provide full references for the source of information.

**T3A3** Annotate each source of information provided and analyse how it is useful in identifying business priorities OR suitability for implementation of a technology. Your annotations must:
- state how the information provides an insight into a business priority
- state how the information provides an insight into the suitability for implementation of a technology
NOTE: You must have at least TWO sources of information which relate to suitability and TWO sources which relate to business priorities

In order to determine and identify business priorities and suitability of the implementation of Docker firstly we must understand what Docker is. Docker is a software as a service product that uses OS level virtualization to create software that is packaged into containers. The software containers can then be isolated from each other, but can also communicate with each other through well defined channels. Thus, it is related to a virtual machine. However, the containers create only the exact number of content that is required for them to function, they are more lightweight virtual machines, because there's no need to create another operating system on top of the host operating system. This can help reduce a lot of server issues and allow more each server to run more Docker containers than there are virtual machines, thus saving up space and allowing more efficiency for the company to produce things on a massive scale. 

Facebook the company, has several focuses in terms of applications. They prioritize on the applications of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and use these to allow users to stay in touch with friends meet new people find communities and too many other social networking capabilities.

In recent times, Facebook has abopted a new priority, and that is to create a privacy focused platform. As stated in the first quarter of 2019 conference call, Facebook wants to allow for more private interactions, which allows for the establishment of intimate spaces where each user has complete confidence that what they say and what they type is completely private. They also want to focus on encryption, which means that communications should be more secure, to an extent that even Facebook itself is unable to see what is being shared or what has been written. Moreover, historical messages should not be kept in permanence, meaning it shouldn't be kept longer than necessary.

The most important functionalities are interoperability, which allows that the interconnectedness between all of the applications such that it's more easier to communicate across networks. And finally, improvements to data storage, such that sensitive data is not stored in countries on platforms that may be improperly accessed because of weak laws from government or because of a lack of protection. Therefore this represents one of the business priorities that Facebook has within the next decade.

Another business priority that Facebook has, within the 10 year timeframe is to provide Internet access to two thirds of the people on the planet who are not connected, and this also includes allowing them to access Facebook as a social media network and allow them to have these basic services for communication. In order to accomplish that, Facebook needs to improve on its current data storage, since the company has a motive of scaling, and generating more for the same amount of resources.

This is actually quoted by Zuckerberg as the 'greatest scale, ambition and resources' to compete. The issue therefore lies in its current data storage structure and implementing Docker will allow servers to better be prepared to store data in a more efficient method.

In regards to the suitability of whether Docker should be implemented by Facebook, well in actuality it is already being in implemented by Facebook.

And it addresses the need for increasing in privacy for social media and digital connections. Because Docker itself is a very secure platform, and it only in each container image only runs what is necessary for Docker to complete its tasks. And therefore, there is very little room for malicious orchestrators to be able to breach a Docker container and then execute commands to make it escape the container and have access to the entire server. This falls under the suitability of whether Facebook should implement a platform such as Docker.

------------------------------------------------

**T3A4** Create a draft list of at least THREE business priorities you have identified based on your research. Each priority should only be a single statement or sentence.

 - A privacy-focused platform with secure data storage and encrypted messages.
 - Earning trust through increasing transparency on significant events, such as elections.
 - Continue to address the issues associated with data storage on a large scale, to facilitate an increased membership base.
